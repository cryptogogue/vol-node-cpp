svg layout template - part of ledger? or part of wallet?
does it matter if there are multiple layouts?
should layout be hashed?

svg url

RGB
CMYK
FOIL
...

localization?

ENG
JP
IT
...

customization?

field + aspect

fat fields:
    field filter... localizable string, printable media, etc.
    asset can be assembled with field hints to simplify
    hash on media computed separately from asset
    no need to hash asset - always in a valid state (except user-modified fields)

object template - url
customizable fields - fat fields (parsed by client)
client has to have layout engine
OR... layout comes from layout server?

asset metadata... just a field? excluded by default? yeah...
schema metadata... also application specific
schema metadata can include reusable templates
up to app designer to structure metadata (and layout engine)
