// To compare chains:
// 1. Find the common root.
// 2. Get the interval between the timestamp of the end of the longest branch and its first block (excluding the root).
//      a. From the interval, divide by the lookback window to calculate COMPARE_COUNT.
// 3. From the common root, up to the COMPARE_COUNT, compare each block and tally the score for each chain.
//      a. +1 for the winner, -1 to the loser; 0 if tied.
// 4. Select the winner.
//      a. The chain with the highest score wins.
//      b. If chains are tied and the same length, pick the chain with the best ending block.
//      c. If chains are tied and different length, extend the shorter chain by one as a tie-breaker.
